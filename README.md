# TVP-VAR Modelling of Macroeconomic Data

## Description

In this project, I investigate the effectiveness of time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) models in modelling the UK economy over a 30-year period. Macroeconomic data is imported from the Federal Reserve of Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis.
